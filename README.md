# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
## Stakeholders expect projects to be delivered on agreed upon timelines. For example a paying customer will not expect a project to be in development forever. Project managers need to use time management tools and people manaagement skills to keep a project within set deadlines.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
## Projects will have a cost to them projected to deliver that project. Controling costs will ensure budget overuns are avoided. Activities like clear planing and execution of tasks will ensure that project activities remain within the planned budget.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
## Waterfall is linear and more rigid. One task only begins when the previous one is complete. Agile is flexible and used for smaller projects that have requirements that can change quickly and change often. Waterfall is easy to follow and has less room for changes which can simplify execution. Agile methodologies are advantageous for projects that have a sharp turn around and can be used for emergency projects that need to be implemented quickly.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
## Waterfall is more suited for large complex software projects. Agile is used for smaller projects that have requirements that can change quickly and change often.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
## Ensure that you take a process oriented approach and focus on preventing defects in the sofware as you are buidling it. Maintaining high quality standards as you build out software will result in less bugs once you have completed the process.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
## A clear scope alows you to properly plan the needed components and needed steps to achieve the project software. Additionally, the more clear your scope the easier for you to estimate time and financial budgets. A WBS is a visual tool used to breakdown larger complex tasks into smaller more managable pieces that are easier to digest and solve. This is useful because it takes a complex project and reduces it to its core pieces that can be solved more easily.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
## This allows you to ensure that the project is delivered/completed within the deadline. By scheduling all major parts of the project you are ensuring that activities are executed and completed in good time. Gantt charts are a visual tool to allow you to visualise schedules in a way that is more understandable.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
## 

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
## A software that is not designed to answer a specific questioin may fall short and not address the actual problem. Clear definition is paramount.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
## Keep the language simple and fun. It must be engaging and uses stories and examples to make the audience understand the painpoint and how the software will solve it.

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
## 

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
## 

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
## Understanding what the competition is currently doing allows you to craft a solution that will have a unique selling point so as to have a clear value proposition to your potential users.
